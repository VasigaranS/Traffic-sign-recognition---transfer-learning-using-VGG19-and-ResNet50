Traffic sign recognition - transfer learning using VGG19 and ResNet50
In this project, CNN Architecture (VGG19 and ResNet50) and Transfer Learning are used to de- termine the best classifier for traffic sign recogni- tion. The study involves two classification tasks: a multiclass-classification task and a binary clas- sification task for detecting speed limit signs. The dataset used is GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark). The outcomes of this project indicate that batch size, learning rate, and picture resolution all have a significant influence on the performance. On the contrary, utilizing a deeper network (ResNet50), or the SGD optimizer did not improve the performance. only accept psuedo labels with certain threshold accuracy in their probability
